"Eat da Burger" (Sequelize Version)

https://sheltered-hamlet-17331.herokuapp.com/

This version of 'Eat da Burger' uses Sequelize to implement its ORMs.

With this simple Bootstraps UI, the user can create, view and 'devour' burgers.
In addition, there are two api routes for full `(/api/burgers)` and selected
`(/api/burgers/:id)` burger data in JSON format. See footer for direct link.

The app uses a MySQL database, which is connected to the above Heroku link via
the JawsDB add-on.

Bon appetit!
